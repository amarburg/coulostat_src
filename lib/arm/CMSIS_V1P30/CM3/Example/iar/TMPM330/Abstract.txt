This example project uses CMSIS and demonstrates 
the use of Systick in interrupt driven mode

Board:  Keil MCBTMPM330 Evaluation Board
Device: TMPM330 

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           10.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           40.00 MHz

The example program is available for target:
  MCBTMPM330:  - runs from Internal Flash located on chip




-- CMSIS ---------------------------------------------
SystemInit       called from startup_TMPM330.s
SystemCoreClock  is 40000000Hz
SysTick          runs in interrupt mode
