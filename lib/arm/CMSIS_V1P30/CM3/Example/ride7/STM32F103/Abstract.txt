This example project uses CMSIS and demonstrates 
the use of Systick in interrupt driven mode

Board:  Keil MCBSTM32E Evaluation Board
Device: STM32F103ZET6 

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz

The example project is available for target:
  MCBSTM32E:   - runs from Internal Flash located on chip



-- CMSIS ---------------------------------------------
SystemInit       called from startup_stm32F10x_hd.s
SystemCoreClock  is 72000000Hz
SysTick          runs in interrupt mode
