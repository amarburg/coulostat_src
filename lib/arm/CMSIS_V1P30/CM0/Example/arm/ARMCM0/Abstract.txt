This example project uses CMSIS and demonstrates 
the use of Systick in interrupt driven mode

Board:  none
Device: ARMCM0

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz

The Example program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  ARMCM0:      - runs from Internal Flash located on chip




-- CMSIS ---------------------------------------------
SystemInit       called from startup_amrcm0.s
SystemCoreClock  is 72000000Hz
SysTick          runs in interrupt mode
